🍋 Little Lemon – Reserve a Table (Mobile UI Design)

📱 Overview

This project is a UX/UI design prototype for the “Reserve a Table” feature on the mobile version of the Little Lemon restaurant website. 
The goal is to improve user experience by providing a seamless, intuitive, and mobile-friendly table reservation system.

🎯 Problem Statement

Little Lemon does not currently offer an online table reservation feature, which leads to customer friction, missed opportunities, and increased dependency on phone calls or walk-ins. 
This feature aims to fill that gap with a user-centered, mobile-first design.
